When I was getting started with Clojure, 
I was really impressed with how well the language 
embodied its guiding principles: it was concise, expressive, 
clear, and consistent. But having worked as a technical 
writer and editor, I thought the documentation
could be improved. This app is kind of a mash-up of the
Closure cheatsheet and clojuredocs.org â€” ideally 
you'd be able to drill down and focus on a single 
core function, but within the context of that function's 
family of related functions. By zooming in and out, from 
the 10 or so top-level categories to the discussion of
 an individual function, you'd learn the language 
faster and more thoroughly. All in a clean, consistent 
interface that reflects the language's design principles.
